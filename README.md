# People and Places that Shape Ontario

This project highlights notable people and notable facts from Ontario’s provincial ridings through an interactive StoryMap and ArcGIS Dashboard. It was developed as part of the **INF2540 Practicum** in the **Master of Information (MI)** program at the **University of Toronto**, in collaboration with the **Ontario Legislative Library**.

The project supports exploration of people and places that have shaped Ontario across different fields, time periods, and communities.
